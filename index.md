# Welcome to OWASP Guatemala Chapter 

We are a bunch of friendly people interested in Application Security, spreading the word about security issues and how to prevent or solve them, and as Software is all over these days, means we
are interested in every flavour of security. 

## Social media
* Our meetings and events are scheduled and promoted on our [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/owaspgt/) 


## Speaking at OWASP Guatemala Chapter Events
Call For Speakers is open - if you would like to present a talk on Application Security at future OWASP Guatemala Chapter
events - please review and agree with the OWASP Speaker Agreement and send the proposed talk title, abstract and speaker
bio to the Chapter Leaders via e-mail.
